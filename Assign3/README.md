Haskell Math Library

This project is a math library made with Haskell for my CS1XA3 class to help me with my math homework. Documementation can be viewed in the Docs directory.

Functionaliy:

Contains and expression datatype that can encode Addition, Multplication, Subtraction, Divition, Cos, Sin , Log, Exponent, Natural exponent, Matrices, Variables, and Constants. 

Can parse certain strings into that expression datatype (syntax in docs).

Can perform partial differentiation.

Can perform some simplification of expression

The outline of the library as well as some Utility Combinators for my parser are taken from Curtis Dâ€™alves. This Can be found at http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/#outline-container-org2a5d6f3
